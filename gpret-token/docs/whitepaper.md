# GPRET Whitepaper
## Global Prime Real Estate Token - Zero Revenue Edition

**Version 1.0 | January 2025**

---

## Abstract

GPRET (Global Prime Real Estate Token) represents a revolutionary approach to blockchain-based asset tracking by implementing a **complete zero-revenue model**. Unlike traditional DeFi projects that prioritize profit generation, GPRET serves as a pure technological demonstration of how blockchain technology can track real-world asset prices without any financial incentives for developers or token holders.

This whitepaper outlines the technical architecture, governance mechanisms, and philosophical foundations of a token designed explicitly to generate **zero revenue** while providing valuable insights into global prime real estate market trends.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The cryptocurrency and DeFi space is saturated with profit-driven projects that often prioritize token price appreciation over technological innovation and community value. This creates several issues:

- **Speculation over utility**: Most tokens become speculative assets rather than functional tools
- **Unsustainable tokenomics**: Reward mechanisms that cannot be maintained long-term
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Profit-generating tokens face increasing regulatory scrutiny
- **Community division**: Focus on profits creates tension between early and late participants

### 1.2 The Zero-Revenue Solution

GPRET addresses these challenges by embracing a **zero-revenue philosophy**:

- **No financial incentives**: Eliminates speculation-driven participation
- **Pure utility focus**: Token serves only as a technology demonstration
- **Regulatory clarity**: Zero-revenue model reduces regulatory risk
- **Community unity**: All participants are equal with no profit expectations

### 1.3 Real Estate Price Tracking

Real estate represents one of the world's largest asset classes, yet reliable, transparent, and decentralized price tracking remains challenging. GPRET demonstrates how blockchain technology can create a transparent, community-governed system for tracking prime real estate prices across major global markets.

## 2. Technical Architecture

## 3. Tracked Markets

### 3.1 Global Coverage

GPRET tracks prime real estate prices in 10 major global markets:

1. **New York** (Manhattan Premium Districts)
2. **London** (Central London Prime Areas)
3. **Tokyo** (Shibuya/Shinjuku Premium)
4. **Hong Kong** (Central District)
5. **Singapore** (Orchard Road Corridor)
6. **Paris** (1st Arrondissement)
7. **Sydney** (CBD Premium)
8. **Toronto** (Downtown Core)
9. **Seoul** (Gangnam District)
10. **Zurich** (City Center Premium)

### 3.2 Price Index Calculation

The global GPRET price index is calculated using:

- **Equal weighting**: Each city contributes equally to the index
- **Base index**: 1000 (starting value)
- **Update frequency**: Daily
- **Validation**: Multi-source verification
- **Transparency**: All calculations are on-chain

### 3.3 Data Sources

To maintain the zero-cost model, GPRET uses only free data sources:

- Public real estate APIs
- Government housing data
- Open market indices
- Community-contributed data
- Academic research databases

## 4. Governance Mechanism

### 4.1 Proposal System

Community governance operates through a transparent proposal system:

#### Proposal Creation
- **Requirement**: Minimum 0.1% of total supply
- **Duration**: 1-30 days voting period
- **Cost**: Zero fees
- **Transparency**: All proposals on-chain

#### Voting Mechanism
- **Weight**: Based on token balance at proposal time
- **Method**: Simple majority (for/against)
- **Participation**: Any token holder can vote
- **Cost**: Only gas fees (no additional charges)

### 4.2 Governance Scope

The community can vote on:

- Adding new cities to track
- Modifying oracle data sources
- Updating governance parameters
- Technical improvement proposals
- Community management decisions

### 4.3 Staking and Governance Weight

While staking provides governance weight multipliers, it offers **zero financial rewards**:

| Staking Period | Governance Multiplier | Financial Reward |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 7 days        | 1.00x              | 0%               |
| 30 days       | 1.10x              | 0%               |
| 90 days       | 1.25x              | 0%               |
| 180 days      | 1.50x              | 0%               |
| 365 days      | 2.00x              | 0%               |

**Note**: Governance multipliers only affect voting weight, not token rewards.
